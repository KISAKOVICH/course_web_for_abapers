            He dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love,
            because by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her.
            Petra Cotes, for her part, loved him more and more as she felt his love increasing,
            and that was how in the ripeness of autumn she began to believe once more in the youthful superstition
            that poverty was the servitude of love.
            Both looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth,
            and the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their
            lives to find the paradise of shared solitude. Madly in love after so many years of sterile complicity,
            they enjoyed the miracle of living each other as much at the table as in bed,
            and they grew to be so happy that even when they were two worn-out people
            they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like dogs.
